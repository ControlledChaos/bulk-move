Move or remove posts in bulk from one category to another.

## Description ##

Bulk Move is a WordPress Plugin which can be used to move posts in bulk from one category to another. This Plugin can also be used to remove posts from a certain category.

If you looking for deleting posts, instead of just moving them, then use [Bulk Delete Plugin][2] instead.

### Development

The development of the Plugin happens over at [github][6]. If you want to contribute to the Plugin, fork the [project at github][6] and send me a pull request.

If you are not familiar with either git or Github then refer to this [guide to see how fork and send pull request](http://sudarmuthu.com/blog/contributing-to-project-hosted-in-github).
